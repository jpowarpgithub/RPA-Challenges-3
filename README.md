Challenge #3
Payment Settlement Bot

Develop a Settlement Bot that will go to the payment settlement file portal to download the report for the day; Unzip the folder; Open the .txt files in the folder; Get the important details needed such as the account number (the first 10 digits), amount (the second digit under the account number), and the reference number (the last random text after the date); 

Hints:-

Go to the settlement file portal to fill in your details and download the files needed.
Unzip the folder to reveal each file.
Perform string manipulation for each text file to get the details needed.
Paste details in an excel with headers (Account Number, Amount, and Reference Number)

Concepts you will learn:

Excel Automation
Web Automation
File and Folder Automation
String Manipulation
Email Automation
Tools to use:

Any RPA software such as UiPath, BluePrism, AutomationAnywhere, PowerAutomate, etc that you are familiar with.

I have prepared a beginner project and included all the necessary details to guide you through the process.  I would appreciate it if you could review it and provide suggestions on how we can enhance the UI-Path coding for a more effective outcome.
